# The Box Model

To master CSS it is important to know layouts and positioning. And the best way to that is with **The Box Model**. 

ℹ️ _It is also sometimes called the **Normal FLow** or the **Default** because nothing has been changed on the **display** property_

> ## Objective
Build a project highlighting the basic functions of a **Box Model**:
- Indicating the space between adjacent _elements_ and the _border_ with the  `Margin`
- Giving space around an _element_ and the _padding_ with the `Border` 
- Adding room around  _elements_ and the _border_ with the `padding`
